# RandomPasswordGenerator

## Description
My motivation for creating this project was to give users a way to create a strong and secure password by selecting inputs of how they wanted their password created. This solves the issues of having to create a new password for things and keeps them from being easy to guess. I learned how to use javaScript more effectively and store user inputs and use them to create new objects.

## Installation
The steps for installing this program is to simply open github pages and go to the deployed application for the repo.

## Usage

To use this website click on the generate password button. Then follow the prompts on the screen. If you fail to answer the prompts within the parameters, the code will tell you and ask you to click the button again to start over. If all is done correctly you should see your new strong password displayed on the website.
